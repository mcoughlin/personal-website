## Science
* ZTF transient follow-up (GWs, SGRBs, TNOs)
    * Monitoring of the WD binary systems identified in the original PTF data.
    * Follow-up of potential ZTF WD binary systems
    * Follow-up of potential ATLAS WD binary  systems

* WD Binaries – PTF and ZTF
    * Monitoring of the ZTF transients identified in the SGRB follow-up work.
    * ZTF transients, especially those identified as fast fading, in preparation for SGRB and GW follow-up, is important. 

* Gravitational Lens Time Delays
    * Time delay measurement for GAIA + PS1 lens systems
    * https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07601

* Astroseismology
    * Low-mass pulsating white dwarfs

* Calibration/Technical
    * Photometric stability and performance of EMCCDs as a function of EM gain. 
    * Multiband colors in UBVRI of hot DA white dwarf stars from Gaia.
